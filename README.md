12/03/16 - El Taco Gestapo Mob was instantiated.
12/03/16 - T.G.M. is currently a solo effort, if you would like to contribute please fork any of these T.G. projects. All pull requests will be considered in the order they are received. Currently there are no secure coms open, that will change soon. there will be a status update every evening until every bulleted point on the checklist is tested, optimized, and deployed. v1.0 of all the breakfast code will be showing up before 12/11/16. All T.G. code, with the exception of the BreakfastOS, is written in Typsecript2, and Anuglar2 and the cli project for Angular2. you can read more at http://cli.angular.io. We are presently seeking legitimate endorsements on the underground channels. please do not attempt to contact us anywhere but github, your messages will bounce and we'll never see them. today was a productive day, I took a 2 hour walk and drank 1/2 a beer, about 1g of 30% THC flowers, 0.5mg of Alprazolam at 4pm.
